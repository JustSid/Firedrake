##Getting started
Before you can build Firedrake, you need the following packages:
* grub-rescue-pc
* xorriso
* llvm
* clang

The next thing you need to do is to chmod the Image generator script, cd into /Bootable and run
> chmod +x ./CreateImage.sh

##Compiling Firedrake
cd into the Firedrake directory (the one which includes THIS file, ya know?) and then run
> make
> make install

The make install is only needed if you want to create a bootable .iso file, but why wouldn't you want this? After all you are here to replace you current OS, aren't you?
